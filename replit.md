# eBhangar - Smart Scrap Collection Platform

## Overview

eBhangar is a web-based service platform for managing scrap collection and recycling services. The application connects customers who want to dispose of recyclable items (electronics, metals, plastics, paper, etc.) with verified vendors who collect and pay for these materials. The platform features real-time booking management, vendor assignment, and order tracking with an eco-friendly design theme.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing:** Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (phone-based OTP)

**Design System:**
The application implements a hybrid design approach combining Material Design principles with service platform patterns (similar to Uber/Swiggy). Key design decisions include:
- Green eco-theme with HSL color values for consistency across light/dark modes
- Typography using Inter (UI/body) and Poppins (headers) from Google Fonts
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Custom hover/active states using CSS elevation patterns

**Key Frontend Patterns:**
- Context-based authentication state management (AuthContext)
- Theme provider for light/dark mode switching
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Custom hooks for responsive breakpoints and toast notifications
- Data fetching with automatic authentication headers

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Language:** TypeScript (ES Modules)
- **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Session Management:** connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions

**API Structure:**
RESTful API endpoints organized by resource type:
- User management (`/api/users/*`)
- Category operations (`/api/categories/*`)
- Vendor management (`/api/vendors/*`)
- Booking/order operations (`/api/bookings/*`)

**Middleware Architecture:**
- Authentication middleware validates Firebase phone numbers from request headers
- Auto-creates user records on first login
- Role-based access control (customer, vendor, admin)
- Request/response logging for API endpoints
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

**Data Access Layer:**
The storage pattern implements a repository/interface pattern:
- `IStorage` interface defines all data operations
- `DbStorage` class implements the interface using Drizzle ORM
- Supports transactions for complex operations (booking creation with items)
- Relational data fetching with joins

### Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
1. **users** - Stores user accounts with phone-based authentication
   - Fields: id (UUID), phoneNumber (unique), name, address, role (customer/vendor/admin)
   - Auto-generated UUIDs for primary keys

2. **categories** - Scrap item types with pricing
   - Fields: id, name (unique), unit (kg/unit), minRate, maxRate, icon
   - Supports dynamic pricing ranges

3. **vendors** - Vendor profiles linked to user accounts
   - Fields: id, userId (FK to users), location, activePickups counter
   - One-to-one relationship with users

4. **bookings** - Customer orders/pickup requests
   - Fields: id, customerId (FK), customer details (denormalized), totalValue, status, vendorId (FK)
   - Status workflow: pending â†’ assigned â†’ completed
   - Tracks timestamps for creation and completion

5. **bookingItems** - Line items for each booking
   - Fields: id, bookingId (FK), categoryId (FK), categoryName (denormalized), quantity, estimatedValue
   - Supports multiple items per booking

**Design Decisions:**
- UUID primary keys for security and distributed ID generation
- Denormalized customer data in bookings for historical accuracy
- Status-based workflow for order lifecycle
- Decimal types for monetary values to maintain precision
- Timestamps for audit trails

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Frontend uses Firebase Authentication for phone number verification
2. User enters phone number â†’ receives OTP â†’ verifies code
3. Firebase returns authenticated user with phone number
4. Phone number sent in `x-user-phone` header on all API requests
5. Backend validates and auto-creates user records on first login

**Authorization Levels:**
- **Customer:** Can create bookings, view own bookings
- **Vendor:** Can view assigned bookings, update booking status
- **Admin:** Can manage all resources, assign vendors, change user roles

**Security Considerations:**
- Phone number as primary identifier (no passwords)
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL backing
- Role-based middleware for protected routes
- Auto-provisioning reduces friction for new users

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Firebase (Authentication):**
- Purpose: Phone number-based OTP authentication
